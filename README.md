🚨 Credit Card Fraud Detection: Enhancing Security and Reducing Financial Loss 🚨

I'm excited to share a recent project where we tackled the critical issue of credit card fraud using machine learning. With over 550,000 anonymized transactions from European cardholders in 2023, our goal was to develop robust algorithms to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.

 Key Features:
- id: Unique transaction identifier
- V1-V28: Anonymized transaction attributes
- Amount: Transaction amount
- Class: Indicator of fraud (1) or non-fraud (0)

 Business Impact:
💰 Financial Losses: Reducing billions in losses due to fraud.
🛡️ Customer Trust: Maintaining consumer confidence in secure transactions.
📜 Regulatory Compliance: Ensuring adherence to financial regulations.

 Methodology:
🔍 Algorithms Used: Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and One-Class SVM.
🔧 Evaluation Metrics: Precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

 Results:
Isolation Forest:
- Accuracy: 58.46%
- High precision but low recall for fraud detection.

 Next Steps:
- Further model tuning and feature engineering.
- Exploring hybrid models for enhanced detection accuracy.
- Preparing for real-time deployment to safeguard transactions.

 Potential Use Cases:
- Building fraud detection models.
- Analyzing merchant categories and transaction types prone to fraud.
